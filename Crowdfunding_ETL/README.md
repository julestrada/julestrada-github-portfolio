# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project is based on the ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipeline using Pyton and SQL.
Using Pandas, my partner William and I created dataframes based on category and sub-categories.  This step involved lots of data cleaning and sorting to display the data we were looking for.
Once the data was transformed, we created a SQL database where the data was loaded into.
The data was then uploaded into a SQL database for easy data retrieval.
